# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Prework Study Guide will help myself and possibly others, through my Front-End Web Development Bootcamp. It will contain notes from class that will allow me to recall information if and when I need it.  

There were a few issues along the way, errors in syntax leading to things not working properly.  Along the way I have learnt a lot about Git and Git Flow, which I have not really understood before, but I managed to sort out a few issues I had when using Git and GitHub.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

When the page is opened you will see sections for HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.  Each section contains notes for each topic.  These notes are for referencing whilst working in any of the topics.  They can be looked back on whenever needed.

If you open the console you will see the list of topics we have on the page and a suggestion of what to learn.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
